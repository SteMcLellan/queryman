# Queryman
_Electron based application for querying Cosmos DB._

This is a toy project created to allow me to query a Cosmos DB through the DocumentDB API, while also learning about react and react-redux.

This project will need a lot of love before it is usable.

Based off of the template [Enhanced-electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/pbarbiero/enhanced-electron-react-boilerplate)
